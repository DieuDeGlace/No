Posting this for a shader ive been working on for reshade


Making this read me as a sort of guide or explanation of what the shader is.

For starters, installing and ussing it is quite easy. Just put the shader in the reshade-shaders/Shaders folder and it will just work.

As for what it does? well its meant to kinda alter the tonemaps in games giving me "complete" (cant say total as reshade doesn't grab engine data) control over the gamma, contrast, and brightness of a game. It can also saturate or desaturate a game, and alter colors to make a game look a certain way. Since I used to use an RX580, where slapping on 5 diff shaders would tank performance, and sweetfx of the old days was too much of a performance hog, I decided I would try to merge diff things together to make everything i needed for barebones color and tone changes. A lot of this work isn't done by me, like I mentioned, its a merge of diff things. The most I did was just make them not fight one another and work cohesively.
